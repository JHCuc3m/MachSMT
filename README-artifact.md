# MachSMT Artifact for CAV'20 AE


## Setup Steps

1. Clone repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/j29scott/MachSMT.git
  ```

2. Change directory
  ```
  cd MachSMT
  ```

3. Build docker image `machsmt`. This will take approx. 3-5 minutes.
  ```
  docker build -t machsmt --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u) --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g) .
  ```
  **Note** that the `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` are passed to `docker build` in
  order to ensure that the files created by the container have the same
  permissions as the user creating the container (instead of root).

4. Run a `machsmt` container in interactive mode.
  ```
  mkdir results
  docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd)/results:/home/machsmt/results \
    -v $(pwd)/lib:/home/machsmt/lib \
    -it machsmt /bin/bash
  ```
  **Note** that option `--rm` will automatically remove the container when it
  exits, which will also delete all the generated data.
  In order to preserve the data, the above command mounts the
  `$(pwd)/{results,lib}` directories of the host to
  `/home/machsmt/{lib,results}` directories of the container.
  The files generated by MachSMT will be stored in these directories and can be
  easily reviewed outside of the container environment.
